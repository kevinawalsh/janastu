Janastu Jam Social Audio Prototype
----------------------------------

This project contains code for a prototype "social audio" app written by Kevin
Walsh, David Mulry, and Rahul Malik over a very short (too short -- just a few
days!) internship at [Janastu](http://janastu.org/), near the end of a one-month
[May-mester study tour](http://hcbengaluru.tumblr.com) in Bangalore, India,
sponsored by the [College of the Holy Cross](http://holycross.edu/).

More details about the intent of the prototype and the great time we had at
Janastu will be coming soon!
